# Getting Started React QR Code Genrator

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

but it's coustomized for Faster Developing Start By Me

## Needed Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## App Sturcture

Starting with the `./src`

Divided Into 5 sections for diffrent uses

- `.\Components`

* Contain Main Component `QRCodeCard.jsx`

- `./pages`

* Contain Home Page Only Which is Holding the Main Component with Minmal styles

- `index.js` is the heart of the app no needd to change in thing in it & it contains the CSS import so be Cearfully updating it\

- `index.css` this for main is so important because i use it alot with the `Tailwindcss` & the config file of it.

- `app.jsx` contain the starting point of the App

## Some Always used Technologies

- near the React i need some extras for better coding & savuing time Like :-

  - `TailwindCSS` -> for Styling
  - `@heroicons/react` -> for Icons use
  - `qrcode` -> Genrating qrCodes

NOTE: Don't Forget to Use GIT to Organize your Code Versions

`Happy Coding 😁🚀💰`

OR as React Says

`Happy hacking!`
